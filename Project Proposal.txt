a national data set.  We will create additional 

 The columns in our data set are:  State, Name, Number of occurrences, gender and year.  We will create columns for longitude and latitude using state capitals and merge into our dataset.

 We intend to show trends in the top 100 most popular names using the following visualiations:

 - Most popular name per state, displayed on a map using Leaflet
 - Dynamic line charts showing changing popularity of names over time
 - Analyzing name and gender trends over time, by state

 While our project is straight forward in its approach, we believe that it will show provide instights into American society and culture, 
 as well as regional trends when viewed over the period of 1910-2017,
